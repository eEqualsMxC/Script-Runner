 :running::computer: Script Runner is a custom script for an employer who needed a tool to santize their technician log files on a monthly basis. The log files or technicaly  "Failed technian messages", contained on average 400 to 300 specialy formated lines of text. The main objective of the script was to locate specific lines that containg a criteria and delete them. Essentialy, the script does not delete the failed messages, but locates specific text. The script has been in production since August 2020 and the success rate is 100%. 
  
Before emplmenting this script, my employer would spend on average 3-5 hours a week santizing these logs. At which point, my script saves my employer a rather large amount of billable hours. The script is future proofed at some extent. For example, there is a date filter and the script allows a user to make bakups to the log files. 

My future goals to the script is to incorape sqlite and record its own log files. With this lite database, I intend to automate the script monthly. The idea is to not fully rely on the gui to iniate the script. That said, I will need small data base to record its progress and some other packages to alert the end point user on key events.

This script is customized for an employer, and has no productivity for the public.

Enjoy!
